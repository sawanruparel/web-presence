# What I’m Doing Now

I work on **complex, real-world systems** — often at the intersection of **AI, healthcare, and physical products** — where ideas are tested by constraints, not slides.

I’m most interested in problems where:

* The environment is messy
* Incentives are misaligned
* Failure has tangible costs
* Software alone isn’t enough

---

## Current Focus

At the moment, my work clusters around four overlapping pillars:

### 1. Applied Generative AI

Designing GenAI systems that operate in real environments — where correctness, auditability, and system design matter more than demos.

### 2. AI + Physical Systems

Building products that combine embedded systems, robotics, and AI — moving beyond dashboards into systems that sense, decide, and act in the physical world.

### 3. Venture Building & Technical Strategy

Building and scaling ventures where technical architecture and market reality must meet early to survive. I work with teams on product architecture and engineering execution, especially where software meets hardware or regulation.

### 4. Teaching & Mentorship

Teaching applied Generative AI at the University of Connecticut and mentoring engineers who want to build durable systems, not just prototypes.

I am deliberately **not** focused on:

* hype-driven AI projects
* consumer social products
* ideas without a credible path to real-world deployment

## Working Across Domains

While much of my recent work sits in healthcare and hardware, I’m less interested in industries than in **recurring problem structures**.

I carry the same way of thinking across domains.

Across very different sectors, I keep encountering the same patterns:

* **Edge Failures**
  Systems that work in controlled settings but fail at the margins.

* **Invisible Friction**
  Incentives that quietly undermine otherwise sound technical design.

* **The Demo Wall**
  Models that look impressive but collapse under real-world constraints.

* **Boundary Gaps**
  Hardware–software interfaces that teams consistently underestimate.

The domains change. The constraints rhyme.

## Core Beliefs

* **Most GenAI failures aren’t model failures — they’re systems failures.**
  Data flows, validation, incentives, and integration matter more than prompt tuning.

* **Speed without judgment increases entropy.**
  Moving fast only helps if you’re clear about what *not* to build.

* **Hardware startups rarely fail from lack of innovation.**
  They fail from invisible fixed costs, supply-chain realities, and manufacturing complexity.

* **Good engineering is about tradeoffs made explicit.**
  Cleverness is a distant second to clarity.

## How I Work

* **First Principles**
  I start here, especially when constraints are non-obvious.

* **High-Stakes Environments**
  I’m comfortable operating in ambiguous, regulated, and high-consequence spaces.

* **Execution Bias**
  I prefer small, sharp teams. Documents are useful only if they lead to execution.

* **Strong Opinions, Loosely Held**
  I value clear thinking and direct communication.

## Where to Go Next

* Read essays on **building real systems**
* Explore **projects and technical artifacts**
* View **teaching notes** from my GenAI courses
* Reach out if you’re building something genuinely hard and want a thoughtful conversation
