# Sitemap location (you may want to add this later)
# Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml

# Allow all search engines to crawl all content
# This is appropriate for a personal website with public content

# If you want to be more restrictive, you could add:
# Disallow: /admin/
# Disallow: /private/
# Disallow: /api/

# But for a personal web presence showcasing ideas and content,
# allowing full crawling is typically desired
